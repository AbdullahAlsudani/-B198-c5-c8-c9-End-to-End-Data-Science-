📌 Project (( B198(c5-c8-c9) End-to-End Data
 Science Exam)) Overview

The goal of this project is not only to detect fake news, but also to explain why certain articles appear deceptive.

The process includes:

✔️ Preprocessing & TF-IDF vectorisation
✔️ Baseline Logistic Regression classifier
✔️ Ablation with handcrafted “human-judgement” features (punctuation density, capitalisation, sentiment, word length)
✔️ Topic-wise robustness analysis (per subject field)
✔️ Extraction of interpretable feature weights
✔️ Reader checklist to teach humans how to spot misinformation
